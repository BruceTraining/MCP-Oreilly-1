## 🎯 Course Overview

Welcome to the repository for the O'Reilly Live Training: **"Create AI Agents with Model Context Protocol (MCP)"**. This hands-on course provides developers with practical experience in building AI agents that leverage the emerging MCP standard - the protocol that's becoming the HTTP of AI agent communication.

### 🔗 Course Details
- **Course Link**: [O'Reilly Live Training](https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/create-ai-agents-with-model-context-protocol-mcp/0642572196868/0642572196851/)
- **Instructor**: Bruce Hopkins (Intel Software Innovator for AI & Oracle Java Champion)
- **Duration**: 4 hours of hands-on learning
- **Format**: Live online training with interactive demos

## 🌟 Why MCP Matters

Just as HTTP standardized web client-server communication and FTP standardized file transfer, **Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the emerging standard for AI agent communication**. This open protocol, supported by both OpenAI and Anthropic, enables:

- **Universal Connectivity**: Single clients can access any MCP-compliant agent
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Clients can discover and use new capabilities beyond their original design
- **Secure Integration**: Two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered tools
- **Enterprise Scalability**: Access to corporate, confidential, and personal data sources


## 🔧 Development Tools & SDKs

**Official SDKs Available:**
- **Python**: Complete MCP server and client implementation
- **Java 21**: Enterprise-grade MCP integration
- **Node.js**: Lightweight and flexible MCP development
- **HTTP REST APIs**: Direct protocol interaction for any language

## 🌐 Integration Examples

**MCP Client Applications:**
- **Claude Desktop**: Personal AI assistant with MCP integration
- **ChatGPT Plugins**: Extending GPT capabilities through MCP
- **Custom Applications**: Building your own MCP-enabled tools

**MCP Server Implementations:**
- **File System Access**: Secure local and remote file operations
- **Database Connectivity**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, and other database integrations
- **API Gateways**: RESTful service exposure through MCP
- **Custom Tools**: Domain-specific functionality and business logic

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic programming knowledge in Python, Java, or Node.js
- Experience with HTTP REST API concepts
- Familiarity with ChatGPT or Claude interactions
- API keys for OpenAI or Anthropic Claude
